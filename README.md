How I did this asignment: 
For this Assignment 3, I planned out my app before actually starting it. When doing the assigment, I made sure to follow my plan, but changed things along the way when 
it was necessary or a change would've made things more efficient. Most of the code I used was from the lectures, with some code from bootstrap and a few things I learned when 
using the BootStrap code from that Bootstrap website (this one: https://getbootstrap.com/ ) 

How many files + explanation:
Everything in the Content, Script and Server folders were used. The Content folder contained the two css files that I used to style the pages. Home.css was for the home page only, 
while app.css was for the design of all the other pages. The Script folder had app.js. The Server folder had literally everything else. There should be a small explanation at the 
beginning of every file that explains what the file is for. 

Code source:
Majority of the code is from the lectures. Some of the code (navigation bar, footer, some buttons) came from the BootStrap website (https://getbootstrap.com/). One of the commands
to override the BootStrap CSS (!important) I also learned from the BootStrap website (specifically here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/customize/overview/). 

Media Used: There was no external media like videos or pictures used. 

Color Schemes: I used a color scheme that I found on Adobe Color (https://color.adobe.com/search?q=purple)

Version Control: I began the planning for this assignment on November 16, and then began the project and made my first Git commit the next day. After that any time I made a change in my code I would commit to github. Some major commits were when I first commited (since that was the gitignore and setup stuff), when I rerouted everything, made the nav-bar and then when I made the splash page. All over the course of a few days.

Project Plan: This app is a way to make a detailed list of items that a person wants to buy. It will include information about the item, how much the person wants it and where they can find it.

Home Page: My home page is the splash page, and it has a quick summary of how to get started and then two buttons that send the user to either add and item or to view existing items.

Routing/Controllers: A user can perform the full CRUD. Create: add an item, Read: view items, Update: edit existing items and Delete: delete items.

CSS/BootStrap: I had 2 css files, app.css that styled all of the pages EXCEPT for the home page, which had a separate css file called home.css

Cloud Deployment: Connected to the cloud on MONGODB

Gitignore stuff: this was done in the very first commit
